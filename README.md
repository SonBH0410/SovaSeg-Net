### Dataset
The Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound (MMOTU) dataset consists of two sub-datasets, OTU_2D and OTU_CEUS, containing 1469 2D ultrasound images and 170 CEUS images, respectively. And the MMOTU database was announced and published in the article: A Multi-Modality Ovarian Tumor Ultrasound Image Dataset for Unsupervised Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation
